The backend comprises a webscraper that collects data from four different online databases of clean energy projects, validates the data, reverse geocodes the projects for coordinates and Congressional district information, parses descriptions into standardized schemas, merges duplicate projects, and handles complex logic for custom milestones. I set up the backend to run every month on Google Cloud, with robust backup storage and monitoring. By consolidating information on clean energy projects in New York, we aim to make renewable energy data more accessible and engaging for the public!",
