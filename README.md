I'm Deena, and this is a portfolio I made to share some of my projects, ideas, and stories.

My portfolio is built in Typescript, Javascript, HTML, and CSS and runs on a Next.js framework.

To create the space scenes, I used the Three.js library.

My portfolio is currently deployed on GitHub Pages and accessible at [https://deenasun.github.io/](https://deenasun.github.io/).

I hope you like exploring it! If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please reach out to me at deenasun \[at\] berkeley \[dot\] eduâ€“--I'd love to hear from you!
